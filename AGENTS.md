# Agent Development Guide

## This project at a glance

Hierarchical supervisor agent on Databricks Apps:

- **L1 router** picks one domain. **L2 domain supervisors** (finance, sales)
  each own one Genie space.
- **OBO at the leaf**: L2 supervisors call Genie under the **end-user's
  identity** via `x-forwarded-access-token`. LLM + infra calls stay on the
  app service principal.
- **Genie via the direct SDK**, not MCP. The MCP route
  (`/api/2.0/mcp/genie/{space_id}`) 403s under OBO because it requires a
  scope outside the `user_api_scopes` allowlist (`sql`, `dashboards.genie`,
  `files.files`). The leaf uses `w.genie.start_conversation_and_wait(...)`,
  which works with just `dashboards.genie`.

### Live deployment

- Workspace: `https://fevm-serverless-stable-po64og.cloud.databricks.com`
- CLI profile (PAT): `fevm-stable-po64og`. OAuth profile (needed for
  `databricks apps logs`): `fevm-po64og-oauth`.
- App URL: https://supervisor-example-obo-7474659269459324.aws.databricksapps.com
- Bundle name: `supervisor_example_obo` (DAB resource id), app name:
  `supervisor-example-obo`.
- Genie spaces (created via `/api/2.0/data-rooms`, since the SDK has no
  `create_space`): finance `01f15474886a16d5aa027e0791fa855a`
  (samples.tpch.*), sales `01f15474da541750b15a234e1fcc4145`
  (samples.bakehouse.*).
- MLflow experiment: `1456842180535736`.

### Spec / source-of-truth

- Design + decisions live in [`SPECS/SPEC.md`](SPECS/SPEC.md). Update it
  when the architecture or scope decisions change.
- Tests: `uv run pytest` (smoke tests only — no LLM/Genie calls).
- Lint/format: `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .`.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs ruff + pytest on every PR/push.
- Deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (manual dispatch, OIDC).

### Editing rules of thumb

- **Don't reintroduce the MCP Genie path** unless `user_api_scopes` grows
  to include the right scope. The current SDK leaf is the workaround.
- **Don't widen `user_api_scopes`** beyond `dashboards.genie + sql` without
  a real need — the OBO surface should stay minimal.
- **Adding a domain**: append an entry to `DOMAINS` in
  `agent_server/agent.py`, add the system prompt to `prompts.py`, and
  declare the new `genie_space` resource in `databricks.yml` /
  `manifest.yaml`. Nothing else should need to change.
- **Don't silently bypass OBO**: `OBO_FALLBACK_TO_DEFAULT=1` is a local-dev
  escape hatch only — must be unset in eval/prod.

## MANDATORY First Actions

**Ask the user interactively:**

1. **App deployment target:**
   > "Do you have an existing Databricks app you want to deploy to, or should we create a new one? If existing, what's the app name?"

   *Note: New apps should use the `agent-*` prefix (e.g., `agent-data-analyst`) unless the user specifies otherwise.*

2. **If the user mentions memory, conversation history, or persistence:**
   > "For memory capabilities, do you have an existing Lakebase instance? If so, what's the instance name?"

**Then set up the environment using quickstart:**

1. **Read the quickstart skill** at `.claude/skills/quickstart/SKILL.md` — it contains all available CLI flags, what the script configures, and fallback instructions.
2. **Check if `.env` exists.** If it does, the environment is already configured — read it to find `DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE` and skip to verifying auth. If `.env` does not exist, run quickstart:
   ```bash
   uv run quickstart --profile <profile-name>
   ```
3. Run `databricks auth profiles` to verify the profile is configured and valid.

**CRITICAL: All `databricks` CLI commands must include the profile from `.env`.** Either use `--profile` or set the env var:

```bash
databricks <command> --profile <profile>
# or
DATABRICKS_CONFIG_PROFILE=<profile> databricks <command>
```

> **Why this matters:** Without the profile, the CLI may target the wrong workspace, causing "not found" errors for experiments, apps, or other resources.

## Understanding User Goals

**Ask the user questions to understand what they're building:**

1. **What is the agent's purpose?** (e.g., data analyst assistant, customer support, code helper)
2. **What data or tools does it need access to?**
   - Databases/tables (Unity Catalog)
   - Documents for RAG (Vector Search)
   - Natural language data queries (Genie Spaces)
   - External APIs or services
3. **Any specific Databricks resources they want to connect?**

Use `uv run discover-tools` to show them available resources in their workspace, then help them select the right ones for their use case. **See the `add-tools` skill for how to connect tools and grant permissions.**

## Handling Deployment Errors

**If `databricks bundle deploy` fails with "An app with the same name already exists":**

Ask the user: "I see there's an existing app with the same name. Would you like me to bind it to this bundle so we can manage it, or delete it and create a new one?"

- **If they want to bind**: See the **deploy** skill for binding steps
- **If they want to delete**: Run `databricks apps delete <app-name>` then deploy again

## Supervisor API (Offloading the Agent Loop)

The **Supervisor API** lets Databricks run the tool-selection and agent loop server-side. Declare hosted tools (Genie spaces, UC functions, Knowledge Assistants, UC connection MCP servers, Databricks App endpoints) and call `responses.create()` — Databricks handles the rest.

**Use when the user wants to** connect Genie spaces, UC functions, or other Databricks-hosted tools without managing the agent loop themselves.

**Limitations:**
- Tools run as the app's service principal (no user token forwarding) — grant permissions in `databricks.yml`
- Cannot mix hosted tools with client-side function tools in the same request
- Inference parameters (`temperature`, `top_p`, etc.) are not supported when tools are passed
- `stream` and `background` cannot both be `true` in the same request
- Background mode has a maximum execution time of 30 minutes

**Skills:**
- Use **supervisor-api** to set up the Supervisor API with hosted tools
- Use **supervisor-api-background-mode** for tasks that may exceed HTTP timeout limits (complex multi-tool workflows, large data analysis)

## Agent Evaluation

When the user asks about evaluating their agent (quality, metrics, scorers, datasets, or tracing), suggest installing the **MLflow Skills** from https://github.com/mlflow/skills. These provide expert guidance for evaluation workflows using MLflow's native APIs.

**Relevant skills:**
- **agent-evaluation** — end-to-end evaluation: dataset creation, scorer selection, execution, result analysis
- **instrumenting-with-mlflow-tracing** — set up automatic tracing for debugging and observability
- **analyze-mlflow-trace** — examine span data and assessments to identify issues

**Install command:**
```bash
npx skills add mlflow/skills
```

After installation, the skills will be available as slash commands (e.g., `/agent-evaluation`). This template also includes a built-in `evaluate_agent.py` script — run it with `uv run agent-evaluate` after starting the local server.

## Agent Framework Capabilities

> **IMPORTANT:** When adding any tool to the agent, you MUST also grant permissions in `databricks.yml`. See the **add-tools** skill for required steps and examples.

**Tool Types:**
1. **Unity Catalog Function Tools** - SQL UDFs managed in UC with built-in governance
2. **Agent Code Tools** - Defined directly in agent code for REST APIs and low-latency operations
3. **MCP Tools** - Interoperable tools via Model Context Protocol (Databricks-managed, external, or self-hosted)

**Built-in Tools:**
- **system.ai.python_exec** - Execute Python code dynamically within agent queries (code interpreter)

**Common Patterns:**
- **Structured data retrieval** - Query SQL tables/databases
- **Unstructured data retrieval** - Document search and RAG via Vector Search
- **Code interpreter** - Python execution for analysis via system.ai.python_exec
- **External connections** - Integrate services like Slack via HTTP connections
